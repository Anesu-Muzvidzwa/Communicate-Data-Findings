# Vehicle Properties and the effects on CO2 emissions
## by Boddington Anesu Muzvidzwa


## Dataset

The analysis was based on data that recorded Carbon dioxide emissions by vehicles in Canada. The dataset had 7385 vehicles including variables such as make of the vehicle, fuel type, transmission, combined fuel transmission and CO2 emissions. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debajyotipodder/co2-emission-by-vehicles?select=CO2+Emissions_Canada.csv .Description of the data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debajyotipodder/co2-emission-by-vehicles?select=Data+Description.csv.


## Summary of Findings

One of the strongest relationships observed was between CO2 emissions and combined fuel consumption. The relationship was linear. The degree of relationship varied with the type of fuel used. Diesel had shown that it had a low fuel consumption but a higher co2 emission so itsREADME line of best fit was the most vertical of the five fuels. Regular gasoline and premium gasoline lines of best fit were uniform, showing a gradual increase between the variables co2 emissions and fuel consumption. Ethanolâ€™s graph showed that it had a higher fuel consumption but the lowest CO2 emissions. Natural gas could not be represented as a linear relationship as there was only one vehicle using Natural gas. Engine size also played a role in determining co2 emissions with vehicles having smaller engines producing less carbon dioxide but the final deciding factor was the fuel type used on the engine. Vehicle classes such as compact, mid sized and small SUVs had some of the smallest engine sizes and the least amount of co2 emissions. 

Some interesting observations were that most European car  makers use premium gasoline. Ford motor company had the highest count of vehicles that used Ethanol meaning according to this data set it was the most environmentally friendly. BMW had the highest count of vehicles using premium gasoline with almost all of their vehicles using this fuel.



## Key Insights for Presentation

First plot I am going to present is the distribution of carbon dioxide, this will be a histogram. Next I display the co2 emissions against some of the influential variables like engine size , vehicle class and fuel type. Then finally close it off with a multivariate graph of a regression plot showing the relationship between CO2 emissions vs fuel consumption and gain categorized by fuel types in different colors for a clear visualization.
